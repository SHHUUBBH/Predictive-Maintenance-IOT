Project Plan: Predictive Maintenance for Industrial IoT
1. Define the Objective
Goal: Develop a machine learning model to predict equipment failures using IoT sensor data, enabling proactive maintenance to reduce downtime.
Key Tasks:
Collect and preprocess time-series IoT sensor data (e.g., temperature, vibration, pressure).
Detect anomalies in sensor readings to identify potential failures.
Build a predictive model to forecast when maintenance is needed.
Deploy the model (optional, for bonus resume points) on a cloud platform.
2. Dataset Selection
Use a publicly available dataset to simulate IoT sensor data:
NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Dataset (available on NASA's Prognostics Data Repository):
Contains time-series data from aircraft engines with sensor readings (e.g., temperature, pressure) and remaining useful life (RUL).
Ideal for predictive maintenance tasks.
UCI Machine Learning Repository - Air Pressure System Failure:
Contains sensor data from an air pressure system with labeled failure events.
Suitable for binary classification (failure vs. no failure) and anomaly detection.
Alternative: Kaggle IoT Datasets (e.g., IoT sensor datasets for industrial equipment).
Why These Datasets? They mimic real-world IoT scenarios, are well-documented, and allow you to focus on modeling rather than data collection.
3. Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Time-Series Analysis: Statsmodels (for ARIMA), TensorFlow or PyTorch (for LSTM)
Anomaly Detection: Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM), PyOD
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Cloud Platforms (optional for deployment):
AWS (SageMaker for model training, Lambda for inference)
Azure (Azure Machine Learning or IoT Hub)
Version Control: Git (host code on GitHub for portfolio visibility)
Environment: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for development
4. Project Workflow
Step 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing
Download the chosen dataset (e.g., NASA Turbofan or UCI Air Pressure).
Explore the data:
Check for missing values, outliers, and data types.
Visualize sensor readings over time using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
Preprocess the data:
Handle missing values (imputation or removal).
Normalize/scale features (e.g., MinMaxScaler in Scikit-learn).
Create time-series features (e.g., rolling averages, lagged values).
For NASA dataset, compute Remaining Useful Life (RUL) as the target variable.
Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze trends in sensor data (e.g., how temperature or vibration correlates with failures).
Use time-series plots to identify patterns or anomalies.
Apply statistical tests (e.g., stationarity tests like ADF test using Statsmodels).
Document findings in a clear report (great for showcasing on GitHub).
Step 3: Anomaly Detection
Implement anomaly detection to flag unusual sensor readings:
Algorithms: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or Autoencoders (using TensorFlow).
Evaluate using precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize anomalies on time-series plots to highlight potential failure points.
Step 4: Predictive Modeling
Time-Series Forecasting:
ARIMA: Use Statsmodels to build an ARIMA model for predicting sensor trends or RUL.
LSTM: Build a deep learning model using TensorFlow or PyTorch to capture temporal dependencies.
Input: Sequences of sensor readings (e.g., sliding window of 50 timesteps).
Output: Predicted RUL or probability of failure.
Classification Approach (if using UCI dataset):
Frame as a binary classification problem (failure vs. no failure).
Use algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks.
Split data into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70-20-10 split).
Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE (for regression) or F1-score (for classification).
Step 5: Model Evaluation and Selection
Compare model performance (ARIMA vs. LSTM vs. others).
Use cross-validation for robustness.
Select the best model based on accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
Step 6: (Optional) Model Deployment
Deploy the model on a cloud platform:
AWS SageMaker: Train and host the model, create an endpoint for real-time predictions.
Azure ML: Build a pipeline for inference, integrate with Azure IoT Hub for real-time data.
Simulate real-time IoT data ingestion (e.g., using mock data streams).
Create a simple API to serve predictions (using Flask or FastAPI).
Step 7: Documentation and Visualization
Create a detailed README for your GitHub repository:
Explain the problem, dataset, methodology, and results.
Include visualizations (e.g., time-series plots, anomaly detection results, model performance metrics).
Build a dashboard (optional) using Streamlit or Dash to showcase predictions interactively.
5. Deliverables
Code: Well-commented Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub.
Report: A PDF or Markdown file summarizing the project (problem, approach, results).
Visualizations: Plots of sensor data, anomalies, and model predictions.
Model: A trained model file (e.g., .pkl for Scikit-learn or .h5 for TensorFlow).
(Optional) Deployed model API or dashboard.
6. Timeline
Week 1: Data collection, preprocessing, and EDA.
Week 2: Anomaly detection and initial modeling (ARIMA, basic ML models).
Week 3: Advanced modeling (LSTM) and model evaluation.
Week 4: Documentation, visualization, and (optional) deployment. S
